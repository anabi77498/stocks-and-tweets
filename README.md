# Stocks and Tweets

Collaboration by Asad Nabi, Maite Sadeh, William Swenson and Aaron Hafkin

Our Data Science research project focuses the affect of tweets on stock volatility and changes in stock prices.
We were interested in trying to view if the volatility is affected by tweets about that particular stock and build a prediction of volatility based on this. We were also trying to investigate if the stock price is affected by the attitude of tweets toward a particular company. In other words, are these two variables independent

We were motivated to research this relationship because we were all curious about the short squeeze of particular “meme” stocks in January of 2021, and wanted to see the extent to which social media discussions affect stock price
